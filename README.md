A Garry's Mod Gamemode for the August 2015 Gmod Competition

## Behind it
The competition was held for 14 days .. however life got in the way and I only had 5 days to work on the project.
I'll update/fix the gamemode on another branch, since this is used for the Competition.

## Usage
While the gamemode is dynamic and will scan the given map .. it have only been tested on gm_flatgrass.
It is recommended to only use gm_flatgrass in this early version.
